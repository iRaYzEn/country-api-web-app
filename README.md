# React + Vite + css

i made this site to showoff some skills i have and it went great 
i made this site without knowing a thing about react-router-dom so, you can't use the arrows to move between different countries when clicking on them 
i made this project because i was sick of watching these 60h+ courses on udemy and i figure out if i read the react.dev docs and make a project i would land on something bigger, i think you should follow my approach if you are dealing with same thing. i didn't read all of it though. i read the first three sections and did all the exercises in the end of each article and it was enough for this project.
